## About Me
I am currently a PhD student supervised by [Prof. Marco Hutter](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=DO3quJYAAAAJ&hl=en) at ETH Zurich [Robotic Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/), Switzerland, where I focus on developing learning-based methods for generalized legged locomotion, including both quadruped and humanoid robots. My current research also explores enabling agile and natural parkour-like movements in unstructured environments. Previously, I completed my Master’s degree in [Robotics, Systems, and Control](https://ethz.ch/en/studies/master/degree-programmes/engineering-sciences/robotics-systems-and-control.html) at ETH Zurich. During my Master’s studies, I worked on [integrating model-based and learning-based approaches](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adh5401) to design robust and generalized locomotion controllers for quadrupeds. After that, I also worked on a holistic method that enables legged robots traversing various discontinuous terrains through pure reinforcement learning.

In summary, my research interests focus on developing athletic intelligence for autonomous legged robots, with the goal of enabling these agents to traverse anywhere their biological counterparts can. Beyond locomotion, I am also driven by a broader ambition: empowering legged robots to perform the full spectrum of actions their natural counterparts are capable of—moving, adapting, and interacting with the world with agility and versatility.
